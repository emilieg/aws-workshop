## AWS - Amazon Web Services Intro (20 mins)

AWS or Amazon Web Services is a group of software suites focused on cloud-computing and large scalability of web services. Essentially all the products are part of a PaaS or Platform as a Service.

AWS is utilized by startups and large companies alike for a plethera of different services and apps making it a market-viable technology.

## EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud (15 mins)

Amazon EC2 is the one of the main pieces of technology we'll be utilizing. This platform is used for creating and managing our personal virtual servers. We can deploy websites or apps to these servers as well as use our custom domains.

The EC2 portal can be used to manage our already created servers or to create new ones. To create a new one all you have to do is choose the "Launch Instance" button.

The next screen will display a list of OS images we can install onto our virtual server. Most are Linux-based but Windows Server is also an option (gross)

For most of our needs the Amazon Linux option will work fine.
